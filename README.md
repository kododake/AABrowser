## 📱 Quick Start & Safety Check 🚦

This app is built for passengers, for when you're parked, or for when you're just enjoying a flat, boring "desert world."

### 🛑 Developer's Safety Request (Read This!)

* **You're the Boss:** If you're the driver, **DO NOT LOOK AT THIS APP.** If you think your eyes might wander while steering, please, as your developer, **uninstall it right now!** (Seriously, my brain needs you to be safe.)
* **Legal Note:** I built the code, but the **GPLv3 license** says I am absolutely **NOT RESPONSIBLE** for how you choose to use it. Use your common sense!

**Ready to drive?** If you agree to the license, download the latest APK from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kododake/AABrowser/releases) page.

**P.S. Quick developer confession:** If you download the latest APK and it still shows "Version 1.0"—don't worry! That *is* the newest code (it has all the 1.1 features). I totally messed up and forgot to update the version number *inside* the app before pushing the release. 😅 Just know you have the correct, latest version!
